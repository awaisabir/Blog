# QSocial

A full-stack Javascript app I am creating to help me practice advanced concepts in modern JS technologies. Users will be able to perform CRUD operations on posts, comments, profiles (admins), all together with having their security in mind! This app will be accompanied by a React Native app as well ...

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/awaisabir/QSocial/blob/master/media/current-demo.gif"/></div>

Tech being used are:

- Express.js
- Passport.js
- Mongoose
- JWT Authorization
- Cloudinary API

- React.js
- React Router
- Redux
- SematicUI
