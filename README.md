# QSocial

A full-stack Javascript app I am creating to help me practice advanced concepts in modern JS technologies. Users will be able to perform CRUD operations on posts, comments, profiles (admins), all together with having their security in mind! This app will be accompanied by a React Native app as well (soon) ...

Tech being used are:

- Express.js
- Passport.js
- SQLite (Sequelize)
- JWT Authorization
- Cloudinary API

- React.js
- React Router
- Redux
- SematicUI

--------

## Current Status :nut_and_bolt: :zap: :hammer:

## General

- Need to create documentation on how to get app up and running!

### Backend

- Need to update to SQL before anything!
- Need to complete the Posts API.
  - Get Like and dislikes working
- Trying to create more endpoints for the API.
- Add Support for the Cloudinary API for picture uploads.

### Frontend

- Need to add more complexity to the Profile Page.
